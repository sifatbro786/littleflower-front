<p>Little Flower started in <strong>2000</strong> with a small group of children and a clear promise to parents: steady teaching, good manners and a safe place to grow. Over the years the school moved into its own building in East Kazipara, Kafrul, and grew all the way to SSC.</p>
<p>The results have followed. By the school's own record, Little Flower students have had a <strong>100% SSC pass rate for 18 years</strong>, with <strong>201 A+</strong> results and <strong>531 scholarships</strong>, and the school was recognised as a <strong>best school in 2009 and 2018</strong>.</p>
<p>What has not changed is the feeling of a family school. Teachers know every child by name, birthdays are celebrated in class and guardians are always welcome to talk to the teachers.</p>`,
